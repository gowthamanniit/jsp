SESSION MANAGEMENT USING COOKIE

 To create a cookie

def: - cookie is a small text file
     - cookie is a form of name,value pair
     - cookies are created by server and send to the client with the 'HTTP response headers'.
     - client saves cookies on the local hard disk and sends them along with the 'HTTP request headers' to the server
     
     - servlet API provides Cookie (class ) - javax.servlet.http - package to implement session management using cookie.
     
Cookie class methods:

	String getName()                 - it is used to retrieve name of a cookie.
	void setValue(String value)      -  assign a string value to a cookie
	String getValue()                -  retrieve string value from cookie
	void setComment(String describe) - add comment that describes the function of a cookie
	String getComment()              - it is used to retrieve comment from a cookie
	setMaxAge(int age)				 - to set time duration for client machine cookie.
								     - the time duration is specified in seconds
								  	 - if the time duration is specified as a negative number, the cookie is deleted as soon as the user
								  	   close the web browser.
								  	 - if the time duration is specified as a zero number, the cookie get deleted as soon as it is created.
	int getMaxAge()                  - it is used to retrieve the time duration for which a cookie can exist on the client machine.
	
	 
								  	   
	syntax: To create a cookie
	
		Cookie c1=new Cookie("gowthaman","37");
	
	meaning: (stored to server)
	============================
	c1 = cookie object	
	cookie name = gowthaman
	cookie value = 37
	
	after creating cookie send to the client:
	==========================================
	
	addCookie(Cookie  Cookiename)
	response.addCookie(c1)
		    
	client request the cookie details from server
    =============================================
    
      request.getCookies() --> it will return array (cookie objects array - HTTPServletRequest).
      
      ex:
      
      Cookie cook[]=req.getCookies();
      
      length of cookie = cook.length
      cook[0].getName()
      cook[0].getValue()
      cook[0].setValue("")
      cook[0].setMaxAge(4)
      res.addCookie(cook[0])
